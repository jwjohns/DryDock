# Helm Hull Values
# Contains base configuration values for Helm charts.
# These are typically non-sensitive, static defaults.
# Environment-specific overrides go into helm/cargo/.

# Example: You might put default resource requests/limits here,
# common labels, or default ingress settings.

# (Leave empty for now, assuming chart defaults are sufficient)
